    "## Multirate Signal Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "In many signal processing applications, we would like to change the sampling rate of our digital system. This could mean either reducing or increasing our effective sampling rate. One possibility is to perform digital-to-analog (D/A) conversion, then resample our signal in the time domain to the desired rate. However, this process requires access to the desired resampling circuitry in addition to potential artifacts introduced by the D/A conversion and quantization effects when resampling the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preferred method is to perform rate conversion in the discrete sample domain. We may increase our sampling rate via a process known as upsampling or interpolation, while we may decrease our sampling rate using downsampling or decimation. In the following background sections, we will discuss the mathematical construction of upsampling and downsampling, and also discuss some practical considerations that must be made when working on multirate signal processing."

    "Upsampling (or interpolation) by an integer factor of $U$ is accomplished by interpolating $U-1$ zeros between every entry in our original sequence. Let $x[n]$ be our original signal. Then our upsampled signal $y[n]$ will be as follows:\n",

Thus we see the resulting spectrum will be \"compressed\" along the frequency axis by a factor of $U$ while maintaining the same height. The issue here is that some of our adjacent $2\\pi$ periodic copies of $X_d(\\omega)$ will cross over into the central copy of $Y_d(\\omega)$ after upsampling. This is readily apparent when we check that $Y_d(\\pi) = X_d(\\pi U)$, which must be greater than the $\\pi$ limits of our central copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple solution is to place a low-pass filter after our upsampler to make sure we only extract the frequencies corresponding to the central copy of our original spectrum. We see that the bandwidth of this filter should be such that our cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$ maps to $\\pi$ in our original specturm $X_d(\\omega)$. Thus, we would like $\\omega_c = \\frac{\\pi}{U}$. Formally, our low-pass filter $A(\\omega)$ will be given by\n",

In summary, upsampling by a factor $U$ involves interpolating $U-1$ zeros between each sample in our original signal and then low-pass filtering with a cutoff frequency of $\\frac{\\pi}{U}$ to prevent the inclusion of spurious frequencies presented by adjacent DTFT copies in the original signal."

The anti-aliasing filter should remove all frequencies that would push into adjacent DTFT copies after decimation and cause aliasing. We know that the frequency axis will expand by a factor of $D$; thus, we know any frequencies beyond $\\frac{\\pi}{D}$ would stretch beyond $\\pi$ and alias. Consequently, our anti-aliasing filter $H(\\omega)$ should have the following form:\n",

The difference, of course, is that we filter before decimation and after interpolation. In summary, downsampling by a factor of $D$ requires us to first apply a low-pass anti-aliasing filter with cutoff frequency $\\frac{\\pi}{D}$ then discard (or decimate) every sample that is not located at a multiiple of $D$.

Suppose we would like to increase our sampling rate by a non-integer factor like $\\frac{4}{3}$. How can you interpolate $\\frac{1}{3}$ of a zero? You cannot! Instead, we may accomplish this new sampling rate by first upsampling by a factor of 4, then downsampling by a factor of 3. Furthermore, note that in this case the post-interpolation filter will have a cutoff frequency of $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ and thus eliminate the need for our anti-aliasing filter before decimation since $\\frac{\\pi}{4}<\\frac{\\pi}{3}$! We may achieve any new sampling rate by the same procedure with appropriate anti-aliasing filters."

    "## Least Squares and Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Many fields of signal processing work with optimization problems know as least squares problems. A least square problem may be stated many different ways. One common such way is as follows: suppose we have $N$ input/output pairs where $(x_i,y_i)$ is the $i$'th such pair, $x_i$ is $P$-dimensional and $y_i$ is a scalar. The least squares problem may be given by:\n",
    "\n",

    "\\min_{w} \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N (w^\\top x_i - y_i)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the least squares problem is asking for the vector $w$ that minimizes the sum of our squared errors or, equivalently, our mean squared error (MSE) across all $N$ input/output pairs where we estimate $y_i$ from $\\sum_{j=1}^p x[p]w[p]$. In any context, we would like to minimize the sum of our squared errors or equivalently, our mean squared error (MSE). In vectorized form, the least squares problem may be stated as\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\min_{w} \\frac{1}{N}\\lVert Xw - Y\\rVert^2,\n",

    "\n",
    "### Linear Regression\n",

    "Take a couple minutes to verify the summation and vectorized formulations of the problems are equivalent! Furthermore, it is important to note the importance of the intercept $b$ and the resulting augmentation of the matrix $X$ to accommodate the intercept. Without this intercept, we would only be able to express solutions that pass through the origin of our cooridnate system. In this case, the intercept value allows us to express any line in the $x-y$ plane. Recall from our discussion of adaptive filtering in Lab 6 that we may minimize our objective function by setting its gradient with respect to $\\vec{w}$ to zero. This derivation is as follows:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\vec{w} = \\left(X^\\top X\\right)^{-1}X^\\top Y\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that $X^\\top$ above refers to the transpose of the matrix $X$ and $X^{-1}$ refers to the inverse of a matrix. Thus, we have our solution vector in a relatively simple, closed form. Now, let's try applying this solution to a linear regression problem!"

Therefore, each dataset has roughly 90 low, high temperature pairs. We would like to apply linear regression to predict the high temperature for a given day using only knowledge of the low temperature for that day (low temperatures are $X$, high temperatures are $Y$). Furthermore, it may be interesting to see which season's low temperatures are most predictive of their high temperatures. \n",
